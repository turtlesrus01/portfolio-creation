## This webpage is my personal portfolio

## Description
The page begins with a header bar which contains the logo and navigation bar of three links. These links are named:

1. About Me
2. Work
3. Contact me

There is a side header which describes the section the navigation bar links will take you to. There are content cards which contain work for other projects I have done in the past. Below that, is the Contact Me section, here my email, GitHub profile and phone number are listed.



## Usage 
You can use this page to view my work and contact me if need be.
